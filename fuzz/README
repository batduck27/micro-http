* How to build:
	cargo afl build

* How to run:
	cargo afl fuzz -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir> -x <dictionary> -t 5000 target/debug/micro_http-fuzz

* Examples of input files can be found in ./in;
* An example of a dictionary can be found in ./dictionaries;
* The dictionary option can be ommited. This option is used to help the fuzzer to
  generate better inputs.
* One can resume the previous run by using -i- instead of "-i <input_dir>";

* Examples:
	This will start a new run:
	cargo afl fuzz -i in -o out -x dictionaries/http.dict -t 5000 target/debug/micro_http-fuzz
	
	This will resume the previous run (will start from the generated inputs by the last run):
	cargo afl fuzz -i- -o out -x dictionaries/http.dict -t 5000 target/debug/micro_http-fuzz
